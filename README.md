# RIsk-Dice-Roller

Rules
I have built this app in order to speed up rolling the dice during battles (especially long ones) in Risk board game. Before rolling the dice, both attacker and defender must enter their name and the number of soldiers each of them have on the territories that are in battle.

The attacker will roll 1,2 or 3 dice and he/she must have at least one more army in the territory from which he/she attacks than the number of dice he/she rolls. The defender will roll either 1 or 2 dice.To roll 2 dice, he or she must have at least 2 armies on the territory under attack.

To Decide a Battlec compare the highest die each of players rolled. If the attacker die is higher, the defender loses one army from the territory under attack. But if the highest defenderâ€™s die is higher/equal than the attacker's, the attacker lose one army from the territory he/she attacked from. If both attacker and defender rolled more than one die, compare also the two next-highest dice and repeat the process.

Note: The attacker can never lose more than 2 armies on a single roll.
